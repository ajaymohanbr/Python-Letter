# Python-Letter
A super exiting exercise done as a part of my course where the task was to find the number of letters that can be posted and the task was retricted just to use the If-condition. 
A program in Python that reads:
1: Quantity of money RS the user has to buy envelope and stamp.
2: Price PE of each envelope.
3: Price PS of each stamp.
4: Quantity QE of stamp the user has with him.
5. Quantity QS of envelope the user has with him.

The task was to read the user inputs and let the user know the total number of letters he can send.
